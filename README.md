# DVDBouncingLogo
This is the classic bouncing DVD logo animation synonymous with every childhood memory. This was done in JavaScript with imports from the P5 Processing library and utilises the canvas screen size to determine whether the logo has reached the edge an in turn reverses its direction and then changes its colour. <br><br>Live link - https://ryanrasi.github.io/DVD-Bouncing-Logo/<br><br>This project was inspired by The Coding Train with a few tweaks of my own regarding the speed of the logo as traditionally I believe it was slower than the speed that he inputted whilst I lowered it. <br><br>Link to The Coding Train - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j86zuqqTlQ
